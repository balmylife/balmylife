&emsp;&emsp;京都坐落于本州西部，日本的主要岛屿上。这里是众人眼中日本最美丽的城市之一，一千多年来一直是日本皇室所在，直到1868年被东京取而代之，成为日本现代首都。

&emsp;&emsp;走出现代的京都车站，你可能会纳闷儿：“京都数百年的传统文化都去了哪里？”当你从京都塔俯瞰下面整齐方正的街道时，就算认为自己来到的是其他城市，似乎也情有可原。然而，古老的京都就在你身边，大部分情况下，它近在眼前。

&emsp;&emsp;从京都塔往东走，穿过市中心高楼大厦的重重帘幕之后，便可进入祇园（Gion）的街道。就是在这里，这个古代的娱乐场所，你可以稍微开始窥探京都最迷人的传统景色之一，艺妓（Geisha）。精致，典雅，宛如身处异世界中，艺妓贴切地体现了古京都的风味儿。

&emsp;&emsp;再往东走，来到石塀小路等狭窄小巷，在一排排的传统京都风的院落中感受历史震荡的回音。也正是在这一带地区，你可以找到一些京都最棒的日式旅馆。这些传统旅舍起源于江户时代，你可以舒服的闭上眼睛，在梦中追忆过往。

&emsp;&emsp;搭乘人力车，片刻后便可来到车辆禁止通行的三年坂（Sannen-zaka）和二年坂（Ninen-zaka）街道，探索传统的茶屋和手工艺品商店。

&emsp;&emsp;然后跟随世世代代朝拜者的脚步，来到邻近的山顶寺庙。京都是著名的万寺之都，若要仔细探索所有寺庙，可能要花上一辈子的时间。京都的居民非常重视四季的变化，如四季更迭一般。每个祭祀的地点也都有自己的特色，自己的规矩。京都有许多气氛庄严的大寺，像是平安神宫（Heian Shrine），主奉这座城市的首任和末代天皇。在青莲院（Shorenin Temple）等，占地较小的寺庙中，你可以坐下，在外面的花园中安静沉思。

&emsp;&emsp;然后，造访以石材为主要建材的寺庙，像是清水寺（Kiyomizadera），它是日本最受崇敬的寺庙之一。或是其他以古木建成的寺庙，像是东福寺（Tofukuji），它的廊桥穿梭过一座座枫树和云杉遍野的山谷，是极受欢迎的景点。在京都的所有祭祀场所中，水是不可或缺的必要元素。来到高台寺（Kodai Temple），在代表无尽海洋的细石花园中，任思绪随着水波飘扬。若想欣赏与众不同的水景，请访问南禅寺（Nanzenji），在19世纪的引水渠下休息，这处渠道至今仍供应京都大部分的用水。

&emsp;&emsp;但是京都所有的寺庙，都比不上这座伏见稻荷大社（Fushimi Inari-taisha）。这座寺庙的主神是稻荷狐，寺庙本身横跨整个山坡。
从主殿出发，走上10,000个鸟居夹道的2.5英里步道，景致极为出奇壮观。沿途还有数千个小圣殿，你可以顺道参拜，或停下来喘口气，再登上还有两小时路程的山峰。

&emsp;&emsp;古老的京都不只存在于街道和寺庙间。它存在于二条城（Nijo Castle）的宫殿里，也存在于让人体悟时光珍贵，稍纵即逝的樱花季中。它坐落在岚山竹林沙沙作响的竹叶，和穿入林间的天光云影中，也藏身在神色平静而富有禅意的市区猴子身上。古老的京都也藏匿在涮涮锅等众人合食的蒸腾热气中，在人力车车夫轻柔的脚步中，而当夜幕低垂， 整座城市如点亮的灯笼般闪耀，也必定有它的踪迹。


&emsp;&emsp;也许就在这个时刻，在城市灯光的照射下，你会发现根本没有所谓的古京都，京都穿梭古今，它传递了昔日的跫音，也传递着今日的手机铃声。当世界随着时间的长河快速变动，京都只是安分地守下一段段，一段段值得慢慢品味及享受的美好时光。京都就是京都，在当下，记录永恒。

Kyoto lies in Western Honshu, the main island of Japan. This city, regarded as one of Japan's most beautiful, wore the country's imperial robes for over 1,000 years, until Tokyo became modern capital in 1868.

Emerging from ultra-modern Kyoto Station, you may wonder, "where are the centuries of culture and tradition this city is famous for?" And as you look down upon the gridded streets from Kyoto Tower, you might even be forgiven for thinking you've arrived at the wrong city. Yet, the old Kyoto is all around you, and more often than not, it's right under your nose.

From Kyoto Tower, head east, and push through the curtains of the downtown's high-rise, into the streets of **Gion(祇园)**. It is here, in this historic entertainment quarter, that you'll begin to catch glimpses of one of Kyoto's most alluring traditions, the **geisha(艺妓)**. Refined, artistic and otherworldly, the **geisha** are the very embodiment of old Kyoto.

Venture further east, into narrow alleyways like Ishibe Koji, and feel the echoes of the past amid the rows of traditional Kyoto-style houses. It's in areas like this you'll find some of Kyoto's finest Ryokan. These traditionalinns originated in the Edo period, and are the pferfect places to lay your head and dream of days gone by.

Just a rickshaw ride away, are the traffic-free streets of **Sannen-zaka** and **Ninen-zaka**. Explore the traditional teahouses and crafts shops. 

Then retrace the steps of generations of worshipers who make their way to and from the nearby hilltop temples. Kyoto is known as "the city of 10,000 shrines", and it would take a lifetime to experience them all. Kyoto residents'  place enormous importance in the seasons. And just like the seasons, every place of worship has its own colours, ... its own mood. There are places of spacious austerity, such as the **Heian Shrine(平安神宫)**, dedicated to the first, and the last, of the city's emperors. And intimate places, such as the **Shorenin Temple(青莲院)**, where you are invited to sit, and quietly contemplate the gardens outside.

Visit temples domainated by stone, such as the **Kiyomizadera(清水寺)**, one of the most revered in Japan. And others crafted from ancient timbers, such as **Tofukuji(东福寺)**, loved for its covered bridges which span valleys filled with maple and spruce. Water is an integral and unifying element in all of Kyoto's places of worship. At the **Kodai Temple(高台寺)**, let your thoughts drift across a raked gravel garden which represents the infinite ocean. For a water feature with a difference, visit **Nanzenji(南禅寺)**, and rest beneath the arches of a 19th-century aqueduct, which still supplies much of the city's water.

But of all Kyoto's temples, nothing quite compares to **Fushimi Inari-taisha(伏见稻荷大社)**. Dedicated to the fox spirit, Inari, this temple complex spans an entire mountainside. From the main shrine, climb an extraordinary two and a half mile path lined with 10,000 tori gates. Along the way there are thousands of smaller shrines where you can pay your respects or simply catch your breath, before arriving at the summit two hours later.

It's not just within the streets and temples where you'll find old Kyoto. You'll find it the palace grounds of **Nijo Castle(二条城)**, and in the fleeting cherry blossom season which reminds us of the preciousness of time. It resides amid the whispering leaves and the ethereal light of the Bamboo Forest of Arashiyama, and in the Zen-like calm of the city's resident monkeys. You'll find old Kyoto in the rising steam of a communal dishes like **shabu shabu(涮涮锅)**, in the gentle pad of the rickshaw puller's footsteps, and it can certainly be found as evening falls and the city lights up like a living lantern.

Perhaps it's then, beneath the glow of the city's lights, you'll realize that there is no old Kyoto. Kyoto is timeless, it exists equally in the echoes of the past and in the ringtones of today. As the world rushes by on the river of time, kyoto is but a series of perfect moments,  each to be savored and enjoyed. Kyoto is Kyoto, here, now and forever.
