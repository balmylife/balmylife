##Introduction
**Lexicology is a branch of linguistics, inquiring into the origins and meanings of words.**[#ff0000]
English lexicology is a **theoretically-oriented** course.
**Morphology**(形态学)、**Semantics**(语义学)、**Stylistics**(语体学)、**Etymology**(词源学)
There are two approaches to the study of words, namely **synchronic**(共时研究法) and **diachronic**(历时研究法).
※**Q:** Illustrate the difference of synchronic study and diachronic study of English lexicology with an example.[#6600cc]
**A:** The synchronic approach is concerned with vocabulary of a language as it exists at a given time; it is special descriptive lexicology that deals with the vocabulary and vocabulary units of a particular language at a certain time.[#6600cc]
The diachronic approach deals with the changes and the development of vocabulary in the course of time; it is special historical lexicology that deals with the evolution of the vocabulary units of a languages as time passes.[#6600cc]
From a synchronic point view, the word  *wife*  , for example, now means "a married woman, esp. in relation to her husband" without any consideration of the changes in the past.[#6600cc]
But if we take a diachronic perspective, we will consider the word historically, looking into its origin and changes in form and meaning: the word "wife" evolved from the Old English form "wif", meaning "woman", but later it became specialized in the course of development to the modern meaning "a married woman".[#6600cc]

 词的基本概念和词汇 [18px center]
###一、What is a word?
※ A word is **a minimal free form** of a language that has a given **sound** and **meaning** and **syntacnic function**. [#ff0000]
词是一门语言中具有一定的声音、意义和句法功能的最小单位的自由形式。
①a minimal free form of a language(in visual terms)
②a sound unity(in terms of spoken)
③a unit of meaning(semanticists)
④a form that can function alone in a sentence(grammarians)

Words can be simple and complex, yet all must comply with these criteria.[#009933]
 *Man*  and  *fine*  are simple, but they each have sound, meaning and syntacnic function, and each can be used alone in a sentence.[#009933]
Though  *misfortune*  can be further **divided as**  *mis-*  and  *fortune*  , the **former** cannot **stand alone** as a word. similarly,  *management*  can be **broken down as**  *manage*  and  *-ment*  , the **latter** cannot **be used freely**, either.  *Blackmail*  can be **separated into**  *black*  and  *mail*  , and both can **work as independent** units in a sentence, the meaning of each, however, is by no means the combination of the two.  *Black*  is a colour, opposite to "white" and  *mail*  denotes "something sent by post", yet when they are put together, the combined form means "compel, compulsion, to make payment or action in return for concealment of discreditable secrets etc." Hence  *blackmail*  is a different word.[#009933]

###二、Sound and meaning
The relationship between sound and meaning?
There is **no logical relationship** between sound and meaning as the **symbolic connection** between them is **arbitrary** and **conventional**. [#ff0000]
声音和意义之间没有逻辑关系，因为它们之间的符号联系是任意的和约定俗成的。
① A word is a **symbol** that stands for something else in the word.
② This symbolic connection is almost **arbitrary**（任意的）.
③ The **relationship** between them is **conventional**（约定俗成的） because people of the same speech community have agreed to refer to the animal with this cluster of sounds.

A dog is called a dog not because the sound and the three letters that make up the word just automatically suggest the animal in question.[#009933]
In different languages the same concept can be represented by different sounds. On the other hand, the same sound [mi:t] is used to mean  *meet* ,  *meat* ,  *mete* .  *Knight*  and  *night* , though denoting entirely different things, yet have the same sound.[#009933]

###三、Sound and Form
It is generally agreed that the written form of a natural language is the written record of the **oral** form.
一般来说，一门自然语言的书写形式是该语言口语形式的记录，所以书面语形式应与口语相符合。

但是随着语言的发展，声音和形式之间的差异越来越大。产生这种变化的原因有4个。
①English **alphabet** was **adopted** from the **Romans**.(internal reason)
②The **pronunciation** has **changed** more **rapidly** than spelling over the years, and in some cases the two have drawn far apart.
③Some of the **differences** were **created by** the early **scribes**. 
1」Sometimes, people **deliberately changed spelling** of words either to make  a line even or for easier recognition.
2』Consequently, their **handwriting caused misunderstanding**. To solve the problem in pary, they changed the letter **u** to **o** when it came before **m**, **n**, or **v**.
3」The scribes seem to have decided that **no English word should end** in **u** or **v**. Thus, in time, an **e** was added to such words as **live**, **have**, **due**, and **true** but not pronounced.
④**Borrowing words**.
 
**In the late 1500**, **printing** became well **established**. It helped to **freeze the spelling** of words.
**Dictionaries**, did their share in **stopping spelling chages**.
In spite of the differences, **at least 80%** of the English words **fit consistent spelling patterns**.
 
###四、Vocabulary
※ All the words in a language make up its vocabulary.[#ff0000]
The term ‘vocabulary’ is used in different senses. Not only can it refer to total mumber of the words in a language, but it can stand for all the words in a particular historical period.
 
###五、Classification of words
**1、Basic Word Stock and Nonbasic Vocabulary**
英语词汇按分类原则分为：**基本词汇和非基本词汇（按使用频率）**；**实词和虚词（按概念）**；**本族语词和外来语词（按起源）**。
English words may fall into the **basic word stock** and **nonbasic vocabulary** by **use frequency**.
 **content words** and **functional words** by **notion**.
**native words** and **borrowed words** by **origin**.

※ Major differences between basic and non-basic vocabulary[#6600cc]
**Q: What are the major differences between basic word stock and nonbasic vocabulary?**[#6600cc]
**A:** The **basic word stock** is the **foundation** of the vocabulary accumulated over centuries and forms the **common core** of the language.[#6600cc]
Words, void of the stated characteristics, do not belong to the common core of the language and are nonbasic words.[#6600cc]
**basic word stock have five obvious characteristics：**[#6600cc]
① **All national character** [#6600cc]
② Stability[#6600cc]
③ Productivity[#6600cc]
④ Polysemy[#6600cc]
⑤ Collocability[#6600cc]

**※ Nonbasic words 非基本词汇有7种**
① **Terminology** 术语
Terminology consists of technical terms used in particular disciplines and academic areas.[#ff0000]
术语包括在特定学科和学术领域中使用的技术术语。
e.g.    such as in music:  *symphony* ; in education:  *microteaching* [#009933]
② **Jargon** 行话
Jargon refers to the specialized vocabularies by which members of particular arts, sciences, trades and professions communicate among themselves.[#ff0000]
行话是指特定艺术、科学、贸易和职业之间相互交流的专门词汇
e.g.    such as in bussiness:  *bottom line*  for inescapable implication, unavoidable result, ultimate version;  *ballpark figures*  for estimate[#009933]
③ **Slang** 俚语
Slang belongs to the sub-standard language, a category that seems to stand between the standard general words including informal ones available to everyone and in-group words like cant, jargon and argot, all of which are associated with, or most available to, specific group of the population.[#ff0000]
俚语属于“非标准语言”(sub-standard language)，它似乎介于标准通用词(包括人人都能使用的非正式词)和群体内词(如套话、行话、黑话)之间，而这些词都与特定群体有关，或最适合特定群体使用。
e.g.    such as  *beaver* (girl),  *smoky* ,  *bear* (police),  *catch* (talk to),  *holler* (call),  *roger* (understand),  *X-rays* (radar)[#009933]
④ **Argot** 黑话
Argot generally refers to the jargon of criminals.[#ff0000]
黑话一般是指罪犯使用的行话。
e.g.    such as  *can-opener* (all-purpose key),  *dip* (pick-pocket),  *persuader* (dagger)[#009933]
⑤ **Dialectal words** 方言词
Dialectal words are words used only by speakers of the dialect in question.[#ff0000]
方言词是指仅由使用该方言的人使用的词。
e.g.     *beauty* (AusE=excellent, great),  *chook* (AusE=chicken),  *cocky* (AusE=small farmer),  *station* (AusE=ranch),  *auld* (ScotE=old),  *bluid* (ScotE=blood),  *coo* (ScotE=cow),  *hame* (ScotE=home),  *lough* (IrE=lake),  *bog* (IrE=swamp)[#009933]
⑥ **Archaisms** 古语
Archaisms are words or forms that were once in common use but are now restricted only to specialized or limited use.[#ff0000]
古体词是指曾经普遍使用但现在只被专门或有限使用的词或形式。
e.g.     *thou* (you),  *ye* (plural you),  *thee* (objective you),  *wilt* (will),  *brethren* (brother),  *troth* (pledge),  *quoth* (said),  *aught* (anything),  *hereof* (of this, concerning this),  *therefrom* (from that or there),  *wherein* (in what).[#009933]
⑦ **Neologisms** 新词
 Neologisms are newly-created words or expressions, or words that have taken on new meanings.[#ff0000]
新词(Neologisms)是指新创造的词或表达，或具有新含义的词。
e.g.    futurology=a study that deals with future possibilities based on current trends; AIDS=acquired immune deficiency syndrome[#009933]

**2、Content Words and Functional Words**
**Content words** are known as **National words**
**Functional words** are also called **Empty words**, **Form words**
实词有5类：名词、动词、形容词、副词和数词
![content words.png](https://i.loli.net/2021/03/17/ktgfB9YCilA1TjJ.png)
虚词有4类：介词、连词、助动词、冠词。（在本书中准确说是5类，还有代词，pronoun在学术界存在争议）
**Nine functional words: and, be, have, it, of, the, to. will, you**
![functional words.png](https://i.loli.net/2021/03/17/tSVHIGhpL6AdQjE.png)

**3、Native words and Borrowed words**
①Words may fall into **native words** and **borrowed words** by **origin**.
②As far as the **origins** of the words are concerned ,English words can be classified into **native words** and **borrowed words**.
 
**※ Native words** are words brought to Britain in the fifth century by the German tribes.[#ff0000]
① Neutral in style 文体上 中性
② Frequent in use 使用频繁
Words of **Anglo-Saxon** origin are **small** in number, amounting to **roughly 50,000 to 60,000**, but they form the mainstream of the **basic word stock** and stand at the **core** of the language.
本族语词是公元5世纪由The Angles,the Saxons, the Jutes 三种人带入英国，又称Anglo-Saxon words, 带入的词汇数量不多，大约有5万-6万词，但却形成了英国的基本词汇，也是英语的核心部分。

**※ Borrowed words**
Words taken over from foreign languages are known as **borrowed words** or loan words or borrowing in simple terms. [#ff0000]
According to the **degree of assimilation** and **manner of borrowing**, we can bring the loan-words under four classes.
① **Denizens 同化词**
Denizens are words borrowed early in the past and now well assimilated into the English language.[#ff0000]
② **Aliens 非同化词**
Aliens are borrowed words which have retained their original pronunciation and spelling. [#ff0000]
③ **Translation-loans 译借词**
Translation-loans are words and expressions formed from the existing material in the English language but modelled on the patterns taken from another language.[#ff0000]
④ **Semantic-loans 借义词**
Words of this category are not borrowed with reference to the form.But their meanings are borrowed.   [#ff0000]

经典例题1（2016年单选）
The relationship between sound and meaning is ____ because people of the same speech community have agreed to refer to the thing or the person with this cluster of sounds.
A. arbitrary&emsp;&emsp;B.conventional&emsp;&emsp;C. symbolic&emsp;&emsp;D. fixed

###一、The Indo-European Language Family
![structure](https://inz.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Images/Lexicology%20notes/family%20structure.png)
```table
Eastern(-)    |    Western(-)
Balto-Slavi 波罗的海-斯拉夫语族    |    Celtic 凯尔特语族
Indo-Irania 印度伊朗语族    |    Italic 意大利语族
Armennian 亚美尼亚语    |    Hellenic 希腊语族
Albanian 阿尔巴尼亚语族    |    Germanic 日耳曼语族
```
![branch of language](https://inz.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Images/Lexicology%20notes/branch%20of%20language.png)
以下常考的内容：
① It is assumed that the word has approximately 3,000(some put it 5,000) languages, which can be grouped into roughly 300 language families on the basis of similarities in their **basic word stock** and **grammar**. [#ff0000]
② The Indo-European is one of them. It is made up of most of the languages of **Europe**,**the Near East** , and **India**. （常考） [#ff0000]
③ The five Romance languages,namely,**Portuguese**,**Spanish**,**French**,**Italian**,**Roumanian** all belong to the Italic through an intermediate language called **Latin**. [#ff0000]
④ In the Western set of the language family ,**Greek** is the modern language derived from Hellenic. [#ff0000]
⑤ The Germanic family consists of the four Northern European Languages:**Norwegian** , **Icelandic** , **Danish** and **Swedish**,which are generally known as **Scandinavian** languages. Then there is German,Dutch, Flemish,and English . [#ff0000]
据估计，世界上约有3000多种语言，这些语言可以根据它们的基本词汇和语法的相似性大致划分为300个谱系，印欧语系就是其中一种，由欧洲，近东和印度的大部分语言组成。
 
###二、A Historical Overview of the English Vocabulary ※
学习英语的学生往往认为英语与英国人之间存在着不可分割的联系，殊不知英语成为英语的语言才只有较短的一段时间。
英语最早的居民是凯尔特人，他们的语言是印欧语系的另一个语族凯尔特语族的方言。英国第二大语言是罗马军团带来的拉丁语。

**1、Old English (450-1150)**
![old English](https://inz.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Images/Lexicology%20notes/old%20English.png)
① After the Romans,the Germanic tribes called **Angles** ,**Saxons**,and **Jutes** came and dominated the British isles.Now people generally refer to Anglo-Saxon as **old English**.
② Old English has a vocabulary of about **50,000** to **60,000** words. It was a highly **inflected language** just like modern German.
继罗马人之后，Angles ,Saxons,和Jutes 3个日耳曼部落入侵英伦三岛，并很快永久性地控制了全岛，他们的语言史称 Anglo-Saxon,取得了主导地位，完全替代了凯尔特语，这些岛后来被改称为England ( the land of Angles)。现在人们一般把Anglo-Saxon称为古英语。
古英语约有5万至6万词汇，而且古英语的特点也和现代德语一样是一种高度变化的语言，称为**屈折语**（**highly inflected**）。
Tips：屈折变化，又称词形变化、形态变化。[#808080]

**※ Inflected languages** are a type of synthetic language, which tendency to use a single inflectional morpheme to denote multiple grammatical, syntactic, or semantic features.[#ff0000]
屈折语言是一种综合语言，它倾向于使用一个屈折语素来表示多种语法、句法或语义特征。

**2、Middle English (1150-1500)**
① With the Normans invading England in **1066**, the Norman conquest started a continual flow of **France** words into English.
② In early Middle English period,**English** ,**Latin** and **French** existed side by side.
③ Between **1250** and **1500** about **9,000** words of French origin poured into English. **Seventy-five percent** of them are still in use today. We can find words relating to every aspect of human society.
④ Middle English retained much fewer inflections. If we say that Old English was a language of **full endings**, Middle English was one of **leveled endings**.
1066年诺曼人（法国）入侵英国，古英语开始发生巨大的变化。在此之前，虽然英语也从拉丁语中借词，但影响英语的主要还是日耳曼语。
然而，继诺曼征服之后，法语词汇不断地输入到英语中来。中古英语早期，英语、拉丁语和法语并存。
1250年至1500年间，大约有9000个源自法语的单词涌入英语。其中75% 至今仍在使用。我们可以找到与人类社会各个方面有关的词语。
中古英语保留了很多少的变化，如果我们说古英语是完整词尾的语言，那么中古英语的词尾已经是被削减了的语言。
 
**3、Modern English (1500 - up to now)**
![modern English](https://inz.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Images/Lexicology%20notes/modern%20English.png) 
① Modern English began with the establishment of printing in England.
② In the mid-seventeenth century, the growth of colonization enabled English to absorb words from all major languages of the world.
③ After World War II , English has evolved from a **synthetic language** ( Old English ) to the present **analytic language**.
现代英语始于印刷术在英格兰的建立。
17世纪中期，殖民地的增长使得英语能够吸收世界上所有主要语言的词汇。
第二次世界大战之后，英语从一种综合性语言(古英语)发展到了今天的分析型语言。
 
###三、Growth of Present-day English Vocabulary
**※**现代英语词汇**新词**的三个主要来源：[#6600cc]
**Q: What are the main sources of new words?**[#6600cc]
**A:** Generally, there are **three** main sources of new words: [#6600cc]
①The rapid development of modern science and technology;[#6600cc]
②Social , economic and political changes;[#6600cc]
③The influence of other cultures and languages.[#6600cc]

###四、Modes of Vocabulary Development
![vdmodes](https://inz.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Images/Lexicology%20notes/vdmodes.png)
**※ Modes of Vocabulary Development**
① **Creation** refers to the **formation of new words by using the existing materials**, namely roots,affixes and other elements.In modern time, this is the most important way of vocabulary expansion. [#ff0000]
② **Semantic change** means an old form which takes on a new meaning to meet the new need. [#ff0000]
③ **Borrowing** has played a vital role in the development of vocabulary, particularly in earlier times. [#ff0000]
![example.png](https://i.loli.net/2021/03/17/dQGI8LnB1AkaeqF.png)

##Chapter 3    Word Formation Ⅰ
我们已经讨论了促进英语词汇发展的历史、文化以及社会等方面的因素。虽然在词汇扩展中借词起了重要的作用，但是现代词汇的扩展主要还是靠其内部构词。
也就是说，利用英语中现有的材料不管是本族语材料，还是外来语材料来创造新词。在我们实际讨论构词方式之前，我们需要分析构词的形态结构，实际了解各种构词要素。
**构词法I**
![word formation.png](https://i.loli.net/2021/03/17/Y8UlqIegGKj3M57.png)
###一、Morphemes (词素) ※
**Morphemes: ** The minimal meaningful units are known as morphemes. In other words, the morpheme is the smallest functioning unit in the composition of words.[#ff0000]
语素是最小的意义单位。换句话说，语素是单词构成中最小的功能单位。

Take  *denaturalization*  for example, this is one word, but can be broken down into de-, nature, -al, -ize, -ation, each having meaning of its own.[#009933]
**e.g. **  *Denaturalization*   *de-* ,  *nature* ,  *-al* ,  *-ize* ,  *-ation*  [#009933]

###二、Allomorphs (词素变体) ※
**Morphs (形素):** Morphemes are abstract units, which are realized in speech by discrete units known as morphs.[#ff0000]
语素是抽象的单位，语素在语言中是通过被称为语素的离散单位来实现的。
**Monomorphemic (单词素):** The morphemes coincide with words as they can stand by themselves and function freely in a sentence are known as monomorphemic words.[#ff0000]
语素在句子中可以独立存在，并在句子中自由发挥作用，所以语素与词重合，称为单素词。
**Allomorphs (词素变体):** Some morphemes, however, are realized by more than one morph according to their position in a word. Such alternative morphs are known as allomorphs.[#ff0000]
然而，一些语素根据其在单词中的位置由多个变形来实现。这种可选择的变形称为词素变体。

###三、Types of Morphemes (词素分类) ※
![morpheme.png](https://i.loli.net/2021/03/17/mdXFRLVqDQ6sbx8.png)
**1、Free Morphemes (自由词素)**
**Free Morphemes:** Morphemes which are independent of other morphemes are considered to be free. These morphemes have complete meanings in themselves and can be used as free grammatical units in sentences. [#ff0000]
独立于其他词素的词素被认为是自由的。这些词素本身具有完整的意义，可以作为句子中的自由语法单位使用。
They are identical with root words, e.g.( *man* ,  *earth* ,  *wind* ,  *car* ,  *anger* ) as each of them consists of a single free root, we might as well say that free morphemes are free roots.[#009933]

**2、Bound Morphemes (粘附词素)**
**Bound Morphemes:** Morphemes which can not occur as separate words are bound.[#ff0000]
粘附词素：语素不能单独出现作为独立的单词称之为粘附词素。
Bound morphemes are chiefly found in derived words.
**※Q:** Analyze the morphological structure of the following words and point out the types of the morphemes: recollection, idealistic, ex-prisoner.[#6600cc]
**A:** ~~Take  *recollection* ,  *idealistic*  and  *ex-prisoner*  for example,~~ Each of the three words comprises three morphemes,  *recollection* (re+collect+ion),  *idealistic* (ideal+ist+ic),  *ex-prisoner* (ex+prison+er). There are altogether nine morphemes, of which only  *collect* ,  *ideal*  and  *prison*  can exist by themselves.These are free morhpemes. All the reset  *re-* ,  *-ion* ,  *-ist* ,  *-ic* ,  *ex-* and  *-er*  are bound as none of them are freestanding units.[#6600cc]

① **Bound Root:** A bound root is that part of the word that carries the fundamental meaning just like a free root. It is a bound form and has to combine with other morphemes to make words.[#ff0000]
② **Affixes:** Affixes are forms that are attached to words or word elements to modify **meaning** or **function**.[#ff0000]
1) **Inflectional Affix:** Affixed attached to the end of words to indicate **grammatical** relationship are inflectional, thus known as inflectional morphemes. The number of inflectional affixes is small and stable.[#ff0000]
regular plural suffix(规则的复数后缀): -s(-es)    e.g.  *machines, fridges, desks, radios, potatoes* .[#009933]
simple present for the third person singular(一般现在时的第三人称单数): -s(-es)    **e.g.  *like-likes, work-works, go-goes* **.[#009933]
possessive case of nouns(名词所有格): -' s    e.g.  *the children's library, the man's role, a waitress's voice, the mother-in-law's complaints*.[#009933]
comparative or superlative degrees(比较级或最高级) on adj. or adv: -er, -est    e.g.  *happy-happier-happiest, hard-harder-hardest*.[#009933]
past tense marker(过去式): -ed[#009933]
present participle or gerunds(现在分词或动名词): -ing[#009933]

2) **Derivational affixed:** Affixed added to other morphemes to creat new words. Derivational affixes can be further divided into prefixes and suffixes.[#ff0000]

###四、Root and Stem (词根与词干)
![root.png](https://i.loli.net/2021/03/17/CGlY2ury458Ffic.png)
① **Root:** A root is that part of a word-form that remains when all inflectional and derivational affixes have been removed.[#ff0000]
词根是去掉所有屈折词缀和派生词缀后仍然存在的词形部分。
② **Stem:** A stem is a form to which affixes of any kind can be added,[#ff0000]
词干是可以添加任何种类的词缀的形式.
internationalists一词中， nation既是词根也是词干。而且national, international, internationalist都是词干,它包含词根。

##Chapter 4    Word Formation Ⅱ
通过本章的学习，了解现代英语的主要构词法，这些构词法在英语词汇发展中的地位，提高构词能力，自觉扩大词汇量。
**构词法II**
The **most** productive are **affixation(constitute 30%~40%)**, **compounding(yields 28%~30%)** and **conversion(gives 26%)**.
```table
affixation 词缀法(-)    |    compounding 复合法(-)    |    conversion 转类法(-)    |    shortening 缩略法(-)    |    blending 拼缀法(-)
30%~40%    |    28%~30    |    26%    |   8%~10%   |    1%~5%
```
其中 **shortening**包括**clipping**截短法和**acronymy**首字母拼音法，**affixation最多**，**blending最少**，**conversion占比26%**。

###一、Affixation (词缀法)
![affixation](https://inz.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Images/Lexicology%20notes/affixation.png)
**Affixation** is generally defined as the formation of words by adding word-forming or derivational affixes to stems.(derivation)[#ff0000]
词缀法一般被定义为在词干上加上词缀或派生词缀来构成词(派生法)。

**1、Prefixation**
![prefixation.png](https://i.loli.net/2021/03/17/fs1T4vSmBgtIG3c.png)
**Prefixation** is the formation of new words by adding prefixes to stems. Prefixes do not generally change the word-class of the stem but only modify its meaning.[#ff0000]
前缀是指在词干上加上前缀形成新词。前缀通常不会改变词干的词类，而只是改变词干的意思。

**2、Suffixation**
![suffixation.png](https://i.loli.net/2021/03/17/oFAObtT2QyYre9D.png)
**Suffixation** is the formation of new words by adding suffixes to stems. Suffixes have only a small semantic role, their primary function being to change the grammatical function of stems, they mainly change the word class.[#ff0000]
后缀就是在词干上加后缀形成新词。后缀的语义作用很小，其主要功能是改变词干的语法功能，主要是改变词类。
Prefixes primarily change the **meaning** of the stem, suffixes mainly change the **grammatical function** of stems(change words **class**)
前缀通常改变词义，后缀通常改变单词的语法功能（词类）。

###二、Compounding (复合构词法) ※
**Compounding**, also called composition, is the formation of new words by joining two or more stems.[#ff0000]
复合构词法也称为合成法，是将两个或以上的词干合在一起形成新词的构词方法。
Compounds differ from free phrases in phonetic features, semantic features and grammatical features. 
复合词和短语在语音特征、语义特征和语法特征上都有不同。
Semantic features：“A green hand” means an “inexperienced person”, not “a hand that is green in color”. 
每个复合词表达一个单一的观念。
Grammatical features：“Bad-mouth” used as a verb can take the past tense marker -ed, e.g. He bad-mouthed me.
复合词在语法上独立做成分。
**1、Characteristics of Compounds**
- Phonetic features
- Semantic features
- Grammatical features

**2、Formation of Compounds**
- Noun compounds
- Adjective compounds
- Verb compounds

```table
solid(-)    |    hyphenated(-)    |    open(-)
silkworm    |    honey-bee    |    tear gas
```

###三、Conversion (转类法) ※
```table
Conversion to noun    |    Conversion to verbs
① Verb to noun    |    ① Noun to verb
② Adjective to noun    |    ② Adjective to verb
③ Miscellaneous Conversion    |    ③ Miscellaneous Conversion
```
**Conversion** is the formation of new words by converting words of one class to another class. This is a method of turning words of **one part of speech** to those of a different part of speech.(zero-deviration)[#ff0000]
这是一种把一个词类的词转换成另一个词类的词的方法。

These words are new only in a **grammatical sense**. Since the words do **not** change in **morphological structure** but in function, this process is also known as **functional shift**.
这些词在语法意义上是新词。既然这些词在形态结构上不变，只在功能上有变化，这一转类过程也叫做功能转换。

He was knocked out in the first **round**. **n.**[#009933]
**Round** the number off to the nearest tenth. **v.**[#009933]
The neighbours gathered **round** our barbecue. **prep.**[#009933]
The moon was bright and **round**. **adj.**[#009933]
People came from all the **country** round. **adv.**[#009933]

###四、Blending (拼缀法)
**Blending**: The formation of new words by combining parts of two words or a word plus a part of another word.[#ff0000]
拼缀法是合并两个词的某些部分与一个词／部分词相加+构成一个新词。这样构成的单词被叫做拼缀词或拼缀。
Smoke+ Fog= Smog Motor+ Hotel= Motel[#009933]
**Blends** are mostly used in writing related to science and technology, and to newspapers and magazines. **Though** many of them have already **achieved currency** in English, they are still considered by serious-minded people **to be slang and informal**. Therefore, it is advisable **not** to use such words too often, particularly in formal writing.
**4 major groups**
① Head + Tail
**autocide** from (automobile + suicide)[#009933]
**motel** from (motor + hotel)[#009933]
**slurb** from (slum + suburd)[#009933]
**cremains** from (cremate + remains)[#009933]
**chunnel** from (channel + tunnel)[#009933]
② Head + Head
**comsat** from (communications + satellite)[#009933]
**telex** from (teleprinter + exchange)[#009933]
**Amerinal** from (America + Indian)[#009933]
**sitcom** from (situation + comedy)[#009933]
**FORTRAN** from (formula + translator)[#009933]
③ Head + Word
**medicare** from (medical + care)[#009933]
**Eurasia** from (Europe + Asia)[#009933]
**telequiz** from (telephone + quiz)[#009933]
**autocamp** from (automobile + camp)[#009933]
④ Word + Tail
**lunarnaut** from (lunar + astronaut)[#009933]
**bookmobile** from (book + automobile)[#009933]
**workfare** from (work + welfare)[#009933]
**tourmobile** from (tour + automobile)[#009933]

###五、Clipping (截短法)
**Clipping** is to shorten a longer word by cutting a part off the original and using what remains instead to make a word.[#ff0000]
截短法是把一个较长的词从原词上切掉一部分，然后用剩下的部分组成一个词。
“Exam” is the shortened form of “examination” by back clipping (dorm).
Then “quake” is used to mean “earthquake” by front clipping.
4 common types:
① Front clipping
quake(earthquake), phone(telephone)[#009933]
② Back clipping
dorm(dormitory)[#009933]
③ Front and back clipping
flu(influenza), fridge(refrigerator)[#009933]
④ Phrase clipping
pop (popular music), pub(public house)[#009933]

###六、Acronymy (首字母拼音法)
**Acronymy**: The process of forming new words by joining the initial letters of names of social and political organizations or special noun phrases and technical terms.[#ff0000]
**首字母拼音法是通过将社会、政治组织、特殊的名词或技术术语的首字母连起来，构成新词的方法。**
根据发音不同，叫做**首字母缩略词Initialism**和**首字母拼音词Acronym**。
TV, B.C. (Before Christ)，C.O.D. (cash on delivery)[#009933]

**Initialisms** are words pronounced letter by letter. The letters are separated by periods but most of them have no periods between the letters.[#ff0000]
首字母缩写是指单词一个字母一个字母地发音。这些字母之间有隔音符，但大多数字母之间没有隔音符。
A.D. (Anno Domini = in the year after the birth of Jesus Christ)公元[#009933]
B.C. (Before Christn. 基督；救世主) 公元前[#009933]
C.O.D. (cash on delivery) 货到付款[#009933]

**Acronyms** are words formed from initial letters but pronounced as a normal word.
首字母缩略词是由首字母组成的单词，但发音和普通单词一样。
AIDS （Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome） 获得性免疫缺陷综合症[#009933]
APEC（Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation） 亚太经贸合作组织[#009933]

还有些是用第一个单词的首字母+第二个单词的全部
N-bomb nuclear bomb(原子弹)[#009933]
V-Day Victory Day(胜利日)[#009933]

###七、Back-formation (逆生法)
**Back-formation** is considered to be the opposite process of suffixation.[#ff0000]
逆生法被认为是后缀的相反过程。
The method of creating words by removing the supposed suffixes.
逆生法是除去假定的后缀而创造新词的方法。（逆生法和后缀法对立）
① abstract nouns
② human nouns
③ compound nouns and others
④ adjectives

editor edit 编辑[#009933]
beggar beg 乞求[#009933]
donation donate 捐赠[#009933]

###八、Words from Proper Names (专有名词普通化)
Modern English has a large number of words which come from proper nouns.They include names of people, names of places, names of books and trade names.[#ff0000]
现代英语中有大量由专有名词转化而来的普通名词。包括人名，地名，书名和商标名。
① names of people
② names of places
③ names of books
④ tradenames
Watt 瓦特 （苏格兰发明家）[#009933]
Volta 伏特 （意大利物理学家）[#009933]

##Chapter 5    Word Meaning
通过本章的学习，了解“意义”的不同含义，词义的理据，分清几种常见的意义。
![word meaning.png](https://i.loli.net/2021/03/17/cKLapmYwfB6GU2l.png)
###一、The Meaning of ‘Meaning’ ※
A word is the **combination** of **form** and **meaning**.
By form we mean both its **pronounciation** and **spelling**. Meaning is what the form stands for.
我们所说的形式是指它的发音和拼写。意义是形式所代表的。
For example, the linguistic form cat /kæt/ is used to denote 'a small four-legged animal with soft fur and sharp claws'. It can be said that 'a small four-legged animal with soft fur and sharp claws' is the meaning of the word  *cat* . But 'meaning' is not as simple as it seems to be.[#009933]
![reference.png](https://i.loli.net/2021/03/17/DfbkZIKGg13QHuv.png)
**1、Reference (所指)**
Words are but **symbols**, many of which have meaning only when they have acquired reference.
**Reference** is the relationship between **language** and the **world**.[#ff0000]
The reference of a word to a thing outside the language is **arbitrary** and **convertional**. This connection is the result of **generalization (概括化)** and **abstraction**. The word  *cat* refers to a whole set of animals of the same species.
Although feference is a kind of abstraction, yet with the help of **context**, it can refer to something **specific**.
Jean forgot to feed her cat yesterday evening.[#009933]
The same thing can have different referring expressions without causing any confusion.

**2、Concept (概念)**
In many cases meaning is used in the sense of '**concept**'.
在很多情况下，意义是指“概念”的意义。
Meaning and concept are closely connected but not **identical**.
意义与概念紧密相连，但不尽相同。
**Concept**, which is beyond language, is the result of human cognition, reflecting the objective world in the human mind. [#ff0000]
概念是超越语言的，是人类认知的结果，是客观世界在人心灵中的反映。
It is universal to all men alike regardless of culture, race, language and so on whereas meaning belongs to language, so is restricted to language use.
它是不分文化、种族、语言等所有人都具有的共性，而意义属于语言，所以它局限于语言的使用。
A concept can have as many referring expressions as there are languages in the worlds.
世界上有多少语言，一个概念就有多少个指称表达。
Even in the same language, the same concept can be expressed in different words.
For instance,  *much*  and  *many* both have the same concept, but collocate with different words,  *much time* ,  *much money* ,  *much water* , but  *many people* ,  *many books* ,  *many buildings* , **not vice versa**. [#009933]
例如， *much* 和 *many* 都具有相同的概念，但与不同的单词搭配。

⁉️ **what's the difference between 'vice versa', 'not vice versa' and 'but not vice versa'?** (little doubt🤔️)[#808080]

Synonymous pairs such as  *die -- pass away* ,  *ask -- question* , *quarrel -- argue*  are all good examples. Each pair has the same concept but different **socio-cultural** and **stylistic values**.
同义词对，都是很好的例子。 每对具有相同的概念，但具有不同的社会文化和文体价值。
```table
(-)        |        (-)
much time        |        much money
many people        |        many books
```

**3、Sense (意义)**
**Sense** denotes the relationship **inside** the language. [#ff0000]
It is also an **abstraction**. Every word that has meaning has sense (not every word has reference). 
它也是一种抽象的概念。每个具有意义的单词都具有语义（并非每个单词都有所指）。
For example, probable, nearly, and, if, but, yes, none of which refer to anything in the world, all have some sense.[#009933]
 *pavement*  in British English and  *sidewalk* in American English have the same sense, and so do  *pal*  and  *chum* . [#009933]
```table
Bre(-)        |        AmE(-)        |        (-)
pavement        |        sidewalk        |        人行道
flat        |        apartment        |        公寓
underground        |        subway        |        地铁
autumn        |        fall        |        秋天
```

###二、Motivation (词义的理据) ※
**Motivation** accounts for the connection between the **linguistic symbol** and its **meaning**.[#ff0000]
理据指的是语言符号与其意义之间的联系。
The relationship between the word-form and meaning is conventional and arbitrary, and **most words** can be said to be **non-motivated** That is, the connection of the sign and meaning does **not** have a **logical explanation**.
词形与意义之间的关系是约定俗成的，任意性的，大多数词可以说是没有理据的。也就是说，符号和意义的联系并没有一个合乎逻辑的解释。
**1、Onomatopoeic Motivation (拟声理据)**【ˌɒnəˌmætəˈpiːɪk】
 **Onomatopoeic Motivation**: In modern English some words whose sounds suggest their meanings, for these words were created by imitating the natural sounds, or noises.(conventional) [#ff0000]
拟声理据：在现代英语中，一些词的声音暗示了它们的意思，因为这些词是通过模仿自然的声音或噪音创造出来的。
拟声词(onomatopoetically motivated words)：Crow，quack，trumpet，buzz，croak，bang.[#009933]
Knowing the sounds of the words means understanding the meaning. All the words based on the sounds made by birds, animals, insects, and so on belong to this category.

**2、Morphological Motivation (形态理据)**
**Morphological Motivation** concerns the words whose morphological structures suggest their meaning, for generally speaking, the meaning of a derived word or a compound is based on the meanings of the word-building elements.[#ff0000]
形态理据是指形态结构暗示其意义的词，因为一般来说，派生词或复合词的意义是基于造词成分的意义的。
airmail means to mail by air[#009933]
reading-lamp is the lamp for reading[#009933]
miniskirt is a small skirt[#009933]
hopeless means without hope[#009933]
black market means illegal selling and buying[#009933]
greenhorn means a newcomer[#009933]
 *Black market* , for example, is by no means the 'market black in colour', but it refers to 'illegal selling and buying'. Likewise,  *greenhorn*  is not 'the horn green in colour', but 'a newcomer'.[#009933]

**3、Semantic Motivation (语义理据)**
**Sematic Motivation** refers to the **mental associations** suggested by the conceptual meaning of a word.[#ff0000]
语义理据是指一个词的概念意义所暗示的心理联想。
When we use the  *foot of the mountain* , we are comparing the lower part of the mountain to the foot of a human being.[#009933]
In the sentence 'He is fond of the bottle', bottle remains one of what is contained inside; and  *pen*  and  *sword*  in 'The  *pen*  is mightier than the  *sword* ' suggest 'writing' and 'war' respectively.[#009933]

**4、Etymological Motivation (词源理据)**
The meanings of many words often relate directly to their **origins**. In other words the **history** of the word explains the meaning of the word.[#ff0000]
许多单词的意思往往与其起源直接相关。换句话说，这个词的历史解释了这个词的意义。
For example, now people use  *pen*  for any writing tool though it originally denotes 'feather', because before modern pens were created, feathers were commonly used as writing tools.[#009933]
The word  *laconic*  meaning 'brief' or 'short' is derived from Lacons, a tribe of people who were known for their 'brevity of speech' and for their habit of never using more words than neccessary. Hence a  *laconic*  answer is a 'short answer'.[#009933]
Though people in modern times no longer use feathers in writing, for the sake of **convenience**, the name is **retained**.
All the words **commonized from proper nouns** can be interpreted in terms of their **origins**.
所有从专有名词中通用化的词都可以根据它们的起源来解释。
**（即 所有专有名词的理据，全部都是词源理据）**

###三、Types of Meaning (词义的类别) ※
![Types of meaning.png](https://i.loli.net/2021/03/17/9IiNYqPeEBrphGH.png)
**1、Grammatical Meaning and Lexical Meaning** ★★
**Grammatical Meaning**
**※※ Grammatical meaning** refers to that part of the meaning of the word which indicates grammatical concept or relationships such as **part of speech (词性)** of words ~~(nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs)~~, singular and plural meaning of nouns, tense meaning of verbs and their **inflectional forms**~~(forget, forgets, forgot, forgotten, forgetting)~~. Grammatical meaning of a word becomes important **only** when it is used in **actual context**.[#ff0000]
语法意义指的这个词的意思这表明语法概念或关系，如词性的单词，单数和复数名词的意义、时态动词的意义及其屈折形式。只有当一个词在实际的语境中使用时，它的语法意义才变得重要。
Unlike lexical meaning, different lexical items, which have different lexical meanings, may have the same grammatical meaning, e.g.  *tables* ,  *men* ,  *oxen* ,  *potatoes*  (having the same plural meaning) and  *taught* ,  *worked* ,  *forgave*  (having the same tense (时态) meaning). On the other hand, the same word may have different grammatical meanings as shown in  *forget* ,  *forgets* ,  *forgot* ,  *forgotten* ,  *forgetting* . [#009933]

**Lexical Meaning** (词汇意义)
**Lexical meaning** is that part of the word meaning when grammatical meaning is removed. It embraces two components: conceptural and associative meaning.[#ff0000]

**Functional words** though having **little** lexical meaning, possess **strong grammatical** meaning whereas **content words** have **both** meanings, and **lexical meaning in particular**.
**Lexical meaning and grammatical meaning make up the word-meaning.**
**Lexical meaning** itself has two components: **conceptual meaning** and **associative meaning**.

**2、Conceptual Meaning and Associative Meaning**
**Conceptual Meaning** known as **denotative (外延) meaning** is the meaning given in the **dictionary** and forms the **core** of word-meaning. Being **constant** and **relatively stable**, conceptual meaning forms the **basis** for communication as the same word has the same conceptual meaning to all the speakers of the same language.[#ff0000]
概念意义被称为外延意义，是在词典中给出的意义，构成了词义的核心。概念意义是不变的，相对稳定的，是交际的基础，因为同一个词对同一语言的所有使用者都具有相同的概念意义
Take 'The  *sun*  rises in the east' for example. The word  *sun*  here means 'a heavenly body which gives off light, heat, and energy', a concept which is understood by anyone who speaks English.[#009933]

**Associative Meaning** (联想意义)
**Associative meaning** is the secondary meaning supplemented to the conceptual meaning. It differs from the conceptual meaning in that it is **open-ended** and **indeterminate**. It is liable to the influence of such factors as **culture, experience, religion, geographical region, class background, education**.[#ff0000]
联想意义是对概念意义的补充。它不同于概念意义，因为它是开放的和不确定的。容易受到文化、经历、宗教、地域、阶级背景、教育等因素的影响。

**Associative meaning comprises four types: connotative, stylistic, affective, and collocative.**
① Connotative meaning (内涵意义)
**Connotative meaning** (in contrast to denotative meaning) refers to the overtones or associations suggested by the conceptual meaning, traditionally known as connotations.[#ff0000]
**「or simpler e.g.」**
**Connotation** refers to the overtones or associations suggested by the conceptual meaning.[#ff0000]
内涵是指概念意义所暗示的言外之意或联想。
• East or west, home is best. home：family, safety, love[#009933]
Connotative meaning is **unstable**, **varying considerably (显著不同)** according to **culture**, **historical period**, and the **experience of the individual**.
内涵意义是不稳定的，根据文化、历史时期和个人经验的不同而有很大差异。

② Stylistic meaning (文体意义)
**Stylistic meaning**: Apart from their conceptual meanings, many words have stylistic features, which make them appropriate for different contexts. These distinctive features form the stylistic meanings of words.[#ff0000]
许多词语除了具有概念意义外，还具有文体特征，这使得它们适合于不同的语境。这些鲜明的特征构成了词的文体意义。
• Words are marked as formal, inform,literary,archaic[#009933]
In some dictionaries, these stylistic features are clearly marked as **formal**, **informal**, **literary**, **archaic**, **slang** and so on.
Words such as  *facticity*  (事实性),  *plausibility*  (合理性),  *legitimacy*  (合法性), are obviously formal and appropriate for technical writing.
This stylistic difference is especially true of synonyms.
It is observed that there are few words which have both the conceptual meaning and stylistic meaning.
我们注意到，既具有概念意义又具有文体意义的词很少。
5 degrees of formality: **frozen (刻板)**, **formal**, **consultative (磋商)**, **casual**, **intimate**
People generally do not go that far. They normally classify styles into **formal**, **neutral**, **informal**
```table
住处    |    小狗
domicile (非常正式)    |    diminutive (非常正式)
residence (正式)    |    tiny (口语体)
abode (诗体)    |    wee (口语体，方言)
home (一般的)
```
**※ SAQs** (Short Answer Questions)[#6600cc]
【22】They  *chucked*  a stone at the  *cops* , and then  *did*  a  *bunk*  with the  *loot* . [#6600cc]
【23】 *After casting*  a stone at the  *police* , they  *absconded*  with the  *money* .[#6600cc]
他们向警察扔石头后，带着钱潜逃了。
Apart from the structural difference, the stylistic features of words are obvious. Sentence [22] could be said by two criminals, talking casually about the crime afterwards, so all the words used in italics are slangy, whereas sentence [23] might be said by the chief inspector in making his official report, and thus the words used are literary ( *cast* , *abscond* ) or neutral ( *police* ,  *money* ).[#6600cc]
除了结构上的差异外，词的文体特征也很明显。句子[22]可能出自两个罪犯，随意谈论犯罪之后，所有单词中使用斜体的是俚语，而句子[23]可能由警长所说，在他的官方报告中，用词较为书面(投掷，潜逃)或中性(警察，钱)。

③ Affective meaning (感情意义)
**Affective meaning** indicates the speaker's attitude towards the person or thing in question. [#ff0000]
情感意义表示说话人对问题中的人或事物的态度。
• love, hate, anger, grief; famous, silm, slender; skinny, nigger[#009933]
Words that have emotive values may fall into two categories: **appreciative** or **pejorative**.
Just like connotative meaning, affective meaning varies from individual to individual, from culture to culture, from generation to generation, from society to society.
就像内涵意义一样，情感意义因个人，文化，世代，社会而异。
Words like revolution, freedom, democracy, imperialism may have quite different meanings in different societies and sometimes these 'emotive' overtones are more important in the words' use than the denotations.
“革命”、“自由”、“民主”、“帝国主义”等词在不同的社会中可能有不同的含义，有时这些词引进“感情”意义，在单词使用中它比字面含义更为重要。

④ Collocative meaning (搭配意义)
**Collocative meaning** consists of the associations a word acquires in its collocation.[#ff0000]
搭配意义是指词语在搭配时所产生的联想。
• Pretty，handsome：good looking. Pretty woman；Handsome boy[#009933]
It is again noticeable that collocative meaning overlaps with stylistic and affective meanings because in a sense both stylistic and affective meanings are revealed by means of collocations.
搭配意义与文体意义和情感意义的重叠是值得注意的，因为从某种意义上说，搭配既揭示了文体意义，也揭示了情感意义。

## Chapter 6    Sense Relations and Semantic Field
通过本章的学习，分清词与词之间的几种主要语义关系，它们的概念和特点，能运用这些知识指导语言实践。
语义关系与语义场
![sense relations.png](https://i.loli.net/2021/03/17/r3oiKd5sMecbGWI.png)
###一、Polysemy (一词多义) ※
**1、Two Approaches to Polysemy**
**Polysemy**: Words that have two or more than two senses.[#ff0000]
In modern English, when overwhelming majority of words are **polysemous**.
在现代英语中，绝大多数单词都是一词多义词。
When a word is first coind, it is always **monosemic**.
一个词在被创造之初，它总是单义的。
**Primary meaning** is the only first meaning that a word had when it was created.[#ff0000]

**① Diachronic approach (历时方法)**
Primary meaning (原始意义) 
Derived meanings (意义)
**② Synchronic approach (共时方法)**
the central meaning 核心义 (词的基本意义)
derived meaning 派生意义 (词的次要的外围的意义)

**2、Two Processes of Development**
![radiation.png](https://i.loli.net/2021/03/17/DErpNkMF7obIagc.png)
**Radiation**: It means each of the derived meanings is directly connected to the primary meaning.[#ff0000]
辐射：它的意思是每个衍生意义都与原义直接相连。
• radiation 辐射型
• 辐射型以原始意义为中心，原始意义发展而来的次要意义就像射线那样四处散去。
• 意义之间互不关联，但都可追溯到核心意义。
• face, neck

![concatenation.png](https://i.loli.net/2021/03/17/bcGSZgKH8nhdAiM.png)
**Concatenation**: It refers to a process where each of the later meaning is related only to the preceding one like chains.[#ff0000]
连锁型:：它指的是一个进程，其中后面的每一个意义都只与前面的意义相关，就像链一样。

• concatenation 连锁型
• 连锁型即连接在一起， 连锁型是词义发生关联变化的过程。
• 在这种过程中， 一个词的词义逐渐从原始意义连续转化， 以致在很多情况下， 后起的意义与原始意义已没有任何联系。
• treacle, board, candidate

###二、Homonymy (同形同音异义关系) ※
homonymy【hɔ'mɔnimi】[#808080]
**Homonymy**: Words different in meaning but either identical both in sound and spelling or identical only in sound or spelling.[#ff0000]
同音异义词:意思不同但发音和拼写相同的词，或仅发音或拼写相同的词。

**1、 Types of Homonyms** ★★★【'hɔmənims】
**① Perfect homonyms (完全同音同形异义词)**
**Perfect homonyms** are words identical both in sound and spelling, but different in meaning.[#ff0000]
完全同音异义词是指发音和拼写都相同，但含义不同的词。
bank   bear   date

**② Homographs (同形异义词)**
**Homographs** are words identical only in spelling but different in sound and meaning.[#ff0000]
同形异义词是指拼写相同但发音和意义不同的单词。
sow   bow

**③ Homophones (同音异义词)**
**Homophones** are words indentical only in sound but differnet in spelling and meaning.[#ff0000]
同音异义词是指仅在发音上相同，但在拼写和意义上不同的词。
dear-deer    mail-male    right-write     flower-flour night-knight

同音同形异义词和多义词的区别：
多义词的意思发散，一个起源，在发展的过程中产生不同。
同形同音异义词的词义互不相关。在词典中多义词是列在同一个词条下的，而同形同音异义词则列入不同词条。
一个重要的区分同音同形异义词和多义词的标准是看它们的词源。
```table
Change in sound and spelling(-)    |    Borrowing(-)    |    Shortening(-)
ear    |    fair     |    ad
long    |    ball    |    add
&nbsp;|    &nbsp;    |    rock   
&nbsp;|    &nbsp;    |    Now
```

**2、Origins of Homonyms**
① Change in sound and spelling
② Borrowing
③ Shortening

**※ 3、Differentiation of Homonyms from polysemants** ★★★
**The fundamental difference between homonyms and polysemants lies in the fact that the former refers to different words which happen to share the same form and the latter is one and same owrd which has several distinguishable meanings. One important criterion is to see their etymology, i.e. homonyms are from different sources whereas a polysemant is from the same source which has acquired different meanings in the course of development. The second principal consideration is semantic relatedness**.
同音异义词与多义词的根本区别在于同音异义词指的是同一种形式的不同单词，而多义词是同一种含义不同的单词。一个重要的标准是看它们的词源，即同音异义词来自不同的来源，而多义词来自同一来源，在发展过程中获得了不同的意义。第二个主要考虑因素是语义关系。

The various meanings of a polysement are correlated and connected to one central meaning to a greater or lesser degree, e.g. neck (see 6.1 Polysemy). On the other hand, meanings of different homonyms have nothing to do with one another. In dictionaries, a polysemant has its meanings all listed under one headword whereas homonyms are listed as separate entries.
一个多义词的多个义或多或少都与一个中心义相关联，例如，neck(见6.1 Polysemy)。另一方面，不同的同音异义词的意思彼此之间没有任何关系。在词典中，一个多义词的词义都列在一个词目下，而同音异义词的词义则是单独列出的。

**4、Rhetoric Features of Homonyms**【ˈretərɪk】 ★★★
**As homonyms are identical in sound or spelling, particularly homophones, they are often employed to create puns (双关语) for desired effet of, say, humour, sarcasm or. ridicule. Consider the following conversation that took place between a waitress and a customer in a restaurant.**
由于同音异义词在发音或拼写上是相同的，特别是同音异义词，因此经常被用来制造双关语，以达到幽默、讽刺或嘲笑等目的。考虑一下下面发生在餐厅的女服务员和顾客之间的对话。
[25] “You're not eating your fish,” the waitress said to him.[#009933]
       "Anything wrong with it?"[#009933]
       "Long tiem no sea," the man replied.[#009933]
Long time no see is usually said as a form of greeting between two friends when they meet after a long time. Here the customer cleverly employed the structure of the idiom to his advantage to **criticize** in a **humorous way** the bad quality of the food served at the restaurant. Long time no sea implies that 'sea food kept for a long time is not fit for eating'.[#009933]
Long time no see (好久不见) 通常是两个朋友久别重逢时打招呼的一种方式。在这里，顾客聪明地利用了这个习语的结构，以一种幽默的方式批评了餐厅提供的劣质食物。Long time no sea的意思是“长时间保存的海鲜不适合吃”。[#009933]
[26] "On Sunday they pray for you and on Monday they prey on you."[#009933]
This was the remark made by a London worker on one Sunday morning when he saw groups of the so-called pious gentlemen and ladies entering the church for prayer. Prey meaning 'plunder' or 'rob' sounds the same as pray. In the church, the gentlemen and ladies pry fro blessing from the God, but once out of church, they show their true features, ruthlessly exploiting the working people like ferocious animals preying on their victims. The sardonic tone is unmistakable.[#009933]
这是一位伦敦工人在一个星期天早上说的话，当时他看到一群所谓的虔诚的绅士和女士进入教堂祈祷。“Prey”意为“掠夺”或“抢劫”，听起来和“pray”一样。在教堂里，男男女女们祈求上帝的祝福，但一出教堂，他们就露出了真面目，像凶残的动物一样无情地剥削劳动人民。讽刺的意味跃然纸上。[#009933]

###三、Synonymy (同义关系) ※
**Synonymy** is one of the characteristic features of the vocabulary of natural languages.[#ff0000]
同义关系是自然语言词汇的特征之一。
**1、Definition of Synonyms**
**Synonyms** can be defined as words different in sound and spelling but most nearly alike or exactly the same in meaning.[#ff0000]
同义词可以定义为在声音和拼写上不同但在意义上几乎相同或完全相同的词。
Synonyms 同义词在外延意义(denotation)和词性上要具有相似性。
```table
(-)    |    (-)
end v.  final adj.    |    brother n.—fraternally adv.
结束——最终的    |    兄弟——兄弟似的
```

**2、Types of Synonyms**
① Absolute synonyms (complete synonyms)
绝对同义词也叫完全同义词，也就是从各个方面意思都一样的词：包括语法意义和词汇意义，概念意义和联想意义。
② Relative synonyms (near-synonyms)
（只是意义相似）近义词是相似或几乎相同的单词，但意义有细微不同程度的区别。

**3、Sources of Synonyms**
**① Borrowing ※**
② Dialects and regional English
③ Figurative and euphemistic use of words (词语的比喻和委婉使用)
④ Coincidence with idiomatic expressions (与习惯表达的一致性)

**4、Discrimination of Synonyms**
**同义词的区别归结为三个领域：外延，内涵和应用**
**① Difference in denotation (指示义不同)**
Differences in Range and Intensity of Meaning (意义的范围和强度的差异) 
**② Difference in connotation (内涵不同)**
Differences in stylistic and emotive coloring (风格和情感色彩的差异)
「1 Difference in Stylistic Features
『2 Difference in Emotive Coloring
**③ Difference in Application (应用不同)**
Many synonyms differ in collocations搭配 or distribution分配 in sentences.

###四、Antonymy (反义关系) ※
**1、Types of Antonyms**
**① contradictory terms (互为矛盾的反义词)**
dead-alive; true-false; single/married; male-female

**② contrary terms (相对反义词)**
Antonyms of this type are best viewed in terms of a scale running between two poles or extremes.[#ff0000]
old/young, rich/poor, big/small, cold/hot
Huge／very big／big／quite big／ medium-sized/quite small／small／tiny

**③ relative terms (关系反义词)**
parent/child, husband/wife, employee/employer, sell/buy, receive/give
Antonyms are classified on the basis of semantic opposition.  按语义相反的情况划分
• A word which has more than one meaning can have more than one antonym.
• Some words can have two different types of antonyms at the same time, one being the negative and the other positive.
happy-unhappy/sad,     free-unfree/enslaved奴役的

**2、Some of the Characteristics of Antonyms** ★★★
- they are classified on the basis of **semantic oppositioon**
- a word which has more than one meaning can have more than one antonym
- antonyms differ in semantic inlcusion
- contrary terms are **gradable** antonyms, differing in degree of intensity, so each has its own corresponding opposite
Many words, though having synonyms, do not find their semantic opposites, e.g.  *read, hit, house, book, power, magazine* .
Therefore, in a language, there are a great many **more synonyms than antonyms**.

###五、Hyponymy (上下义关系) ※
**Hyponymy** deals with the relationship of semantic inclusion. That is, the meaning of a more specific word is included in that of another more general word.[#ff0000]
上下义关系研究的是语义包含的关系。也就是说，一个更具体的词的意思包含在另一个更一般的词的意思中。
**Superordinates** are those **general words** while **subordinates** the **specific ones**.
animal are superordinates(上义) while rose, tulip and elephant, tiger are subordinates.(下义)

###六、Semantic Field (语义场)
Apple, pear, peach, orange, lemon...” make up the semantic field fruit.[#009933]

##Chapter 7    Changes in Word Meaning
词汇学第七章的学习，了解词义变化的必然性，词义变化的主要方式和原因。
![changes.png](https://i.loli.net/2021/03/17/Zr9QlsFWSa54nct.png)
###一、Types of Changes ※
Word-meaning changes by modes of **extension, narrowing, **degradation,elevation, and transfer.
词义变化有词义的扩大、词义的缩小、词义的降格、词义的升格以及词义的转移。

**Extension (词义的扩大)**
Extension of meaning, also known as **generalization**. It is a process by which a word which originally had a specialized meaning has now become generalized.[#ff0000]
词义的扩大也称普遍化，是指词的意义的扩展。这是一个词的词义从表达某一专门意义转化到表示概括意义的过程。
• Purse for “money”, dish for “food” [#009933]
• alibi原义为“不在犯罪现场的抗辩”，现义为“辩解，托词”。[#009933]
① polysemic words     e.g. thing business matter
② technical terms    e.g. alibi allergic feedback
③ proper nouns    e.g. lynch sandwich vandal

**Narrowing (词义的缩小)**
Narrowing of meaning also called **specialization**. It is a process by which a word of wide meaning acquires a narrow or specialized sense.[#ff0000]
词义的缩小也称词义的具体化，这是意义范围较大的词向意义范围较小的方向演变的过程。
• "garage" originally simply meant "any safe place", but now means "a place for storing cars"[#009933]
• deer原义为动物，现在指“鹿”。[#009933]
• “meat” originally meant “food”, but now has come to mean “flesh of animals”[#009933]

**Elevation (词义的升格)**
amelioration (改进，改善) [əˌmiːliəˈreɪʃn][#808080]
Elevation or **amelioration** refers to the process by which words rise from humble beginnings to positions of importance.[#ff0000]
词义的升格是指原来表示低微意义的词转化而成为表示重要意义的词的词义演变过程。
• Angel, martyr, paradise, knight[#009933]
• “minister” originally meant“a servant”, now has changed to“a head of a ministry”. [#009933]

**Degradation (词义的降格)**
Degradation or **pejoration** of meaning is the opposite of semantic elevation. It is a process whereby words of good origin fall into ill reputation or non-affective words come to be used in derogatory sense.[#ff0000]
与词义的升格相反，这是词从表示褒扬或中性的意义向表示贬义的意义的演变过程。
• It is much more common for word meanings to change in denotation from neutralto pejorative.[#009933]
• “criticize” has changed from “appraise” to “find fault with”[#009933]
• "silly" used to mean “happy”, but now means “foolish”[#009933]

**Transfer (词义的转移)**
Words which were used to designate one thing but later changed to mean something else have experienced the process of semantic transfer.[#ff0000]
词义的转移是指原先指称某一事物的词后来转而指称另一事物的演变过程。
① Associated transfer (联想转移)
② Abstract - concrete (抽象 - 具体)
③ Subjective - objective (主观的 - 客观的)
④ Transfer of sensations (感觉转移)
