**1、English lexicology embraces other academic disciplines, such as morphology, semantics, etymology, stylistics, lexicography.**
英语词汇学涵盖其他许多学科，如形态学，语义学、词源学、文体学和词典学。
**2、Morphology is the branch of grammar which studies the structure or forms of words, primarily through the use of morpheme construct.**
形态学是语法学的一个分支，主要通过词素研究词的结构或形式。
**3、Modern English is derived from the languages of Germanic tribes with a fairly small vocabulary.**
现代英语起源于古日耳曼语，起初词汇量很小。
**4、Our task is to study English words in different aspects and from different angles.**
我们的任务就是从不同角度研究英语词汇的各个方面。
**5、Stylistics is concerned with the user's choices of linguistic elements in a particular context for special effects.**
文体学主要注重语用者在特定语境中如何选择语言要素。
**6、Lexicography shares with lexicology the same problems: the form, meaning, origins and usages of words, but they have a pragmatic difference.**
词典学和词汇学探讨同样的问题，词汇的形式、意义、起源及用法，但两者在语用上有差异。
**7、Semantics is the study of meanings of different linguistic levels: lexis, syntax, utterance, discourse, etc.**
语义学研究不同语言层次的意义，如词汇、句法、语调、话语等。
**8、Etymology is traditionally used for the study of the origins and history of the form and meaning of words.**
词源学研究词的形式和意义的起源及历史变化。
**9、There are generally two approaches to the study of words, namely synchronic and diachronic.**
一般来说，词汇研究有两种方法：共时研究和历时研究。
**10、From a synchronic pint of view, words can be studied... For example, the word wife now means "a married woman".**
“wife”现在的意思是“已经结婚的女人”，但是在“midwife”、“housewife”这些词语中，它还保留着一个被废弃的意思，即“女人”。这是从共时的角度来讲的。
