**一、which 用法**
which 在英文文法内属于关系代名词(relative pronoun)， 指称「一件事/物件」，例子有﹕
I don’t know which pen is yours (我不知道那支笔才是你的)
在这种情況下，which 指的是那枝属于你的笔。
which亦可以用作连接两句句子，从而对该「事/物件」作出更多描述，例如﹕

> Apple was founded by Steve Jobs (Apple由Steve Jobs 创办)
>             +
> Apple has changed the world. (Apple改变了这个世界)
>             =
> Apple, which was founded by Steve Jobs, has changed the world. (由steve jobs 创办的Apple改变了这个世界)

要记得，which 一定是跟在noun后面!知道了which的基本用法和意思之后，我們就可以看看which 前面加上不同介词到底是意思啦! 首先是in which﹕

二、 in which 用法及中文意思
1、 in which
可以理解为将句子后面的介词(preposition，就是in/ of/ on 等)搬到前面，从而令句子变得更加正式，例子有﹕
> I grew up in this neighborhood.
>             +
This neighborhood has been rebuilt.
>             =

This is the neighborhood in which I grew up has been rebuilt.= This is the neighborhood which I grew up in has been rebuilt (我从小住的那个社区现在已被重建啦)

2、形容「地点」
与此同时，当which是用來形容事物时，in which 就是用來形容「地点」，将两句句子连在一起， 同时亦可以用where代替，但in which 就有比较强调「在..里面」的意思，例如﹕
> I once studied in this university
>         +
> this university is the best one in HK.
>        =
> This is the university where I once studied is the best one in HK= This is the university in which I once studied is the best one in HK (强调他曾经在这所大学里面读过)

记得，如果想用where取代in which的话，需要连preposition(也就是in)都要拿走喔!

三、 of which 用法
1、 介词前置
of which的用法和原理跟in which相似，首先同样是介词前置的用法﹕
> Jane is now working in a company.
>        +
>You must have heard of this company.
>        =
> Jane is now working in a company which you must have heard of. = Jane is now working in a company of which you must have heard. (Jane现在的公司你一定都听过)

2、of which 的另外一个意思是「其中」。
当of which是用作连接两句句子的时候，of which 后面的那句就是在形容前句的其中一项物件，例如﹕
> 前句﹕There are 3 pens on the desk
>           +
> 后句﹕The pen in red is mine
>          =
>There are 3 pens on the desk, of which the pen in red is mine.（桌上有3枝笔，其中红色那枝是我的笔）

在这个例子里面，of which 后面的 ’the pen in red’ 就是在说桌上3枝笔的其中一枝

4. by which 用法
介词前置
同样是介词前置的原理，请看以下例子﹕

He was known by a nickname at school.

+

His nickname is ‘Spiderman’

=

The name by which he was known at school is Spiderman.（他以「蜘蛛人」的绰号在学校內非常有名）

2. by which 的另外一个意思是「藉由…」，

当by which用以连接两句句子时，前句就是后句「动作」的结果，例如﹕

前句﹕He learns English in many ways.

+

后句﹕He takes online English courses to practice his oral English.

=

One of the ways by which he learns English is taking online English courses to practice his oral English. （他其中一个学英文的方法是藉由线上英语课程练习英语会话）
