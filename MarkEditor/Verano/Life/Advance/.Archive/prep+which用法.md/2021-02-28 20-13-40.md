**一、which 用法**
which 在英文文法内属于关系代名词(relative pronoun)， 指称「一件事/物件」，例子有﹕
I don’t know which pen is yours (我不知道那支笔才是你的)
在这种情況下，which 指的是那枝属于你的笔。
which亦可以用作连接两句句子，从而对该「事/物件」作出更多描述，例如﹕

> Apple was founded by Steve Jobs (Apple由Steve Jobs 创办)
>             +
> Apple has changed the world. (Apple改变了这个世界)
>             =
> Apple, which was founded by Steve Jobs, has changed the world. (由steve jobs 创办的Apple改变了这个世界)

要记得，which 一定是跟在noun后面!知道了which的基本用法和意思之后，我們就可以看看which 前面加上不同介词到底是意思啦! 首先是in which﹕

二、 in which 用法及中文意思
1、 in which
可以理解为将句子后面的介词(preposition，就是in/ of/ on 等)搬到前面，从而令句子变得更加正式，例子有﹕
> I grew up in this neighborhood.
>             +
This neighborhood has been rebuilt.
>             =

This is the neighborhood in which I grew up has been rebuilt.= This is the neighborhood which I grew up in has been rebuilt (我从小住的那个社区现在已被重建啦)

2、形容「地点」
与此同时，当which是用來形容事物时，in which 就是用來形容「地点」，将两句句子连在一起， 同时亦可以用where代替，但in which 就有比较强调「在..里面」的意思，例如﹕
> I once studied in this university
>         +
> this university is the best one in HK.
>        =
> This is the university where I once studied is the best one in HK= This is the university in which I once studied is the best one in HK (强调他曾经在这所大学里面读过)

记得，如果想用where取代in which的话，需要连preposition(也就是in)都要拿走喔!

三、 of which 用法
1、 介词前置
of which的用法和原理跟in which相似，首先同样是介词前置的用法﹕
> Jane is now working in a company.
>        +
>You must have heard of this company.
>        =
> Jane is now working in a company which you must have heard of. = Jane is now working in a company of which you must have heard. (Jane现在的公司你一定都听过)

2、of which 的另外一个意思是「其中」。
当of which是用作连接两句句子的时候，of which 后面的那句就是在形容前句的其中一项物件，例如﹕
> 前句﹕There are 3 pens on the desk
>           +
> 后句﹕The pen in red is mine
>          =
> There are 3 pens on the desk, of which the pen in red is mine.（桌上有3枝笔，其中红色那枝是我的笔）

在这个例子里面，of which 后面的 ’the pen in red’ 就是在说桌上3枝笔的其中一枝

四、 by which 用法
1、介词前置
同样是介词前置的原理，请看以下例子﹕
>He was known by a nickname at school.
>+
>His nickname is ‘Spiderman’
>=
> The name by which he was known at school is Spiderman.（他以「蜘蛛人」的绰号在学校內非常有名）

2、 by which 的另外一个意思是「藉由…」，
当by which用以连接两句句子时，前句就是后句「动作」的结果，例如﹕

前句﹕He learns English in many ways.

+

后句﹕He takes online English courses to practice his oral English.

=

One of the ways by which he learns English is taking online English courses to practice his oral English. （他其中一个学英文的方法是藉由线上英语课程练习英语会话）

关于which的更多特殊用法，可以參考以下短片﹕


实战练习考考你(答案在最下方)﹕
The book is sold out + The book is written by JinYoun = ?
I keep all my books in the box + The box was bought from LogOn = ?
Harry Potter has been translated into over 80 languages + The English version of Harry Potter is the most popular and original one = ?
There are 365 days in a year + My favourite day of the year is my birthday = ?
这句有錯嗎? Hong Kong is a crowded city where more than 7 millions people live in
5. at which, on which, for which 用法及意思
和in which/ of which一样，基本上所有「介词+which」的第一个用法都是介词前置，也就是将后句最后的介词放在which 前面。

而意思上就每个字都有不同的意思，用法亦大同小异，同样是用后句形容前句，其中包括﹕

at which = 「在…某一点上」

The picture at which everybody is starring was painted by Da Vinci. (那幅人人都在望的画是达芬奇的作品)

for which = 「为了….」

I will buy you the reference book for which you asked (我会买你提过的那本参考书给你)

on which =「在..上面」

You can take my key from my desk on which there are many photos.(你可以在我的桌上拿我的钥匙，我的桌上有很多照片)

6. who/ whom用法
和which类似的relative pronoun还有who/whom, 不过形容的是人而不是事物。当你指的人是句子的subject时用who指称，如果是object就用whom指称，例如﹕

He is a teacher

          +

He teaches English online

         =

He is a teacher who teaches English online.

在这句里面，’He’是主语，所以用who。又例如﹕

He loves the teacher very much

         +

The teacher teaches English on AmazingTalker

        =

He loves the teacher whom teaches English on AmazingTalker

在这句里面，’He’是主语，’teacher’是object，而后句是在形容teacher，所以中间是用whom而不是who

Ans:
1. The book which is sold out is written by JinYoun

2. The box in which I keep all my book was bought from LogOn.

3. Harry Potter has been translated into over 80 languages, of which the english version is the most popular and original one.

4. There are 365 days in a year, of which my favourite is my birthday.

5. 最后多了一个’in’, 用where的话要拿走preposition，你亦可以寫Hong Kong is a crowded city in which more than 7 millions people live

基本上，「介词+which」最后出來的意思与介词本身的意思有很大的关系
